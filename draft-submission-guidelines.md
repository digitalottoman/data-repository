# Digital Ottoman data repository guidelines


By submitting data to the repository, you agree that this will not be private data anymore. You give permission for the data to be processed towards certain ends, such as Pleiades reference. However, the repository will always make it clear that the datase was produced through your work, and will encourage and assist users to cite the data set properly.

Generally speaking, the repository accepts datasets of any kind and format which refer to any aspect or period or region of Ottoman history, broadly defined. The repository is particularly eager to host research datasets from scholars who have finished and published their work and are ready to share their raw data. 

At this point, the repository is _not_ interested in image files, or in very small datasets (those including fewer than 20 items).

## How will my offer of data be vetted?

Your data will be evaluated for two things: format and usage rights.

A collective of repository editors (Maxim Romanov, Will Hanley) will perform a format review. They will not evaluate the accuracy of the content of the dataset. Instead, they will determine if the data set is well formed (i.e. consistently formatted), and if the dictionary describing its terms is comprehensible.

A collective of copyright editorsy (who?) will perform a basic evaluation of the dataset to determine if there might be some reason that it should _not_ be made public. [additional guidelines needed]

If the data passes these reviews, it will be added to the repository and given a citation and doi, and entered under [what kind of?] open access license. [note: Existing infrastructure can be plugged into--dataverse has an existing citation scheme, for example]

## What will happen to my data after it joins the repository?

- Individual scholars will have access to it for their own research. They will be expected to cite it using the format given (which remains to be defined).
- Participants in the Digital Ottoman projects may reformat it to increase its interoperability with other datasets and projects. The data will always be referenced to you as its original producer.
- The data may be ingested into other projects, such as Pleiades. In the case of Pleiades, this ingestion will be preceded by conversion into [which?] format. Your contribution will be attested on the Pleiades system.

## What metadata do you need to supply along with your dataset?

- Your name
- Your contact information
- Name of dataset
- Brief description (<10 words)
- Extended description (1 paragraph)
- Tags and keywords (indicating date range and geographic range, if possible)
- Number of records contained
- Complete list of primary sources used to produce the dataset
- Date(s) of production
- Funding bodies
- Copyright notes

## Instructions

1. Register yourself in the directory of Ottomanists that we host.
2. Prepare a document describing the vocabulary that you used to create your dataset. For instance, do you use id numbers? What system do you use? What abbreviations does the dataset contain?
3. Prepare the metadata form.
4. Send 2 and 3 (but not yet the dataset) to [address].
5. The repository will respond, offering you a path to send the data by email, by upload, or (if you have a GitHub account) via GitHub. At this point you will be asked to agree to make the dataset public for free (attributed) use. 
6. The repository editors will evaluate the dataset for format and copyright, and ask for any necessary revisions.
7. When approved, the data will be posted in the repository.
