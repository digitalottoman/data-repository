**Name of dataset**: al-Ṯurayyā / al-Thurayya Gazetteer 0.3

**Brief description**: Machine-readable toponymic data for the 10th century Islamic world, including toponyms and routes.

**Extended description**: al-Ṯurayyā is a Gazetter of the Classical Islamic World, and a part and parcel of another project in progress—*Ṣūraŧ al-arḍ*, a geospatial model of the Classical Islamic World (being developed in collaboration with Cameron Jackson, a Senior, double majoring in Arabic and Computer Science @ Tufts University, 2013). This is our first usable demo of al-Ṯhurayyā Gazetteer. Currently it includes over 2,000 toponyms and almost as many route sections georeferenced from Georgette Cornu’s Atlas du monde arabo-islamique à l’époque classique: IXe-Xe siècles (Leiden: Brill, 1983). The gazetteer is searchable (upper left corner), although English equivalents are not yet included; in other words, look for Dimashq/دمشق, not Damascus.
